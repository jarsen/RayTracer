- [x] The ability to trace one ray per pixel.
- [ ] At least one directional light source in the scene.
- [ ] The ability to handle a single shadow ray per intersection.
- [ ] The ability to trace reflection rays at intersections.
- [ ] The ability to trace refraction rays at intersections.
- [ ] Illumination model for intensity calculations, allowing for ambient, diffuse, and specular components.
